			<p>At age 17, while at {{ newStory.Characters.pronoun }} locker after school, {{ newStory.Characters.pronoun }} overheard a conversation.  {{ newStory.Characters.pronoun }}’s 

			classmate Joseph was yelling at Sandra after she had yelled at him for knocking down her NOUN. 
	
			<!-- The NOUN up there should be gotten from using CLARIFAI on an IMAGE that the user has drawn-->

			Joseph scoffed and said, “Whatever Sandra, why don’t you go back to the kitchen where you belong?” 

			On cue, our hero {{ newStory.Characters.name }} sprung into action, <input type="text" class = "custom" name="verbs" placeholder = "ex: reprimanding"> Joseph

			and defending Sandra. Joseph ran off in embarrassment and {{ newStory.Characters.name }} helped Sandra clean up her science project.
